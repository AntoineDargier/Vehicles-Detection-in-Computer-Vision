# Vehicles-Detection-in-Computer-Vision
Computer Vision course, CentraleSupélec, Spring 2023

### Goal
Vehicles detection on dashcams, Kaggle competition

### Language
```Python```

### Contents
1. Data preparation
2. HOG Features
3. SVM
4. Fine-tuning
5. Results

### Libraries
* ```cv2```
* ```pandas```
* ```matplotlib```
* ```numpy```

### Conclusion
The implementation of a car detector
using HOG features and SVM classifier has proven to
be highly effective. I obtain a Sørensen-Dice coefficient of 40%, which
is a very good result.
Outside Deep Learning, this algorithm seems to be the most effective method.
The results achieved were impressive, with the detector able to accurately identify cars with a high
level of precision. Furthermore, the simplicity of the
code and the ease of implementation make this approach an attractive option for real-world applications. Overall, the success of this project highlights
the importance of selecting appropriate feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms to
improve the performance of computer vision systems.
